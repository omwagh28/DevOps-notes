CI/CD & Docker – Short Notes
1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)

CI/CD is a software practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed. It reduces manual work and helps teams deliver features faster and more reliably.

2. Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration means frequently merging code into a shared repository and automatically verifying it.

CI Flow

When a developer pushes code, an automated pipeline starts.

Linting
Checks code style and syntax errors early.
Example: Catching missing brackets or unused variables.

Build
Downloads dependencies and prepares the application.
Example: Creating a Java .jar file.

Unit Testing
Tests individual functions or components.
Mocking is used when a function depends on external services.
Example: Testing login logic without calling a real database.

Security Checks (SCA & SAST)
Scans code and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Example: Detecting insecure libraries.

3. Artifacts

Artifacts are build outputs generated during CI.
They are stored and later used for deployment.

Examples:

JAR / WAR files

Executables

Docker images

Artifacts ensure the same build is tested and deployed.

4. Containers and Docker
Dockerization

Docker packages an application along with its dependencies into a container.

A Docker image is a static build artifact.

It is created using a base image and application layers.

Layers are cached to speed up builds.

Example:
A Node.js app packaged with Node runtime and dependencies.

5. Docker Image Repository

Once built, Docker images are pushed to an artifact repository.

This allows:

Version control

Reusability

Consistent deployments across environments

6. Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment is the process of automatically deploying artifacts to environments after CI.

Deployment may be:

A continuation of CI

Or a separate pipeline

7. System Integration Testing (SIT)

SIT is the first environment where the full application is deployed.

Tests how different services work together

Focuses on system behavior, not individual units

Example:
Checking if order service correctly communicates with payment service.

8. Public IP vs Elastic IP

Public IP
Changes when a server is stopped or restarted.
Suitable for temporary or testing environments.

Elastic IP
Remains fixed even after reboot or stop/start.
Used in production for stable access.

Example:
A production website using a fixed IP address.

9. Summary (Exam-Ready)

CI automates build, test, and security checks

CD automates deployment

Docker ensures portable and consistent environments

Artifacts guarantee same build moves across stages

Elastic IPs provide stable endpoints in production

One-Line Definition (Very Important)

CI/CD is a practice that automates code integration, testing, and deployment to deliver software faster and more reliably.
